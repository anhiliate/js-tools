========

Just some simple tools in JavaScript that I wish I had.

Right now, there are only two but I'll keep adding more. These are hosted on <a href="http://dangoldin.com/js-tools">http://dangoldin.com/js-tools</a>. Feel free to fork and add your own or provide suggestions.

1. Convert a delimited text table into a Bootstrap formatted HTML table. This is useful when copying and pasting data from Excel that you want to display as a Bootstrap table.

2. Generate a BCG style "growth-share" matrix. The UI is currently a bit clunky but the goal is to help generate a chart that you can then take a screenshot of and use wherever.
